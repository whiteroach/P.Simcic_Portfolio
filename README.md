# P.Simcic_Portfolio
Simple portfolio, a bootstrap first-try.

###Description:

This project is part one of my first test in the Web-Development course from DCI. 
I applied my previous knowledge to the basics of bootstrap that I learned in the last week. 
In the forthcoming future, the project will grow following the growth of my knowledge.

###issue
The webpage is fully responsive, but there are some issues with the body, manifested in a white bar under the footer.
